# 500 New Tabs

Chrome Extension to show pretty background images in new tabs from the 500px.com web page.

# Why another extension?

There are already a lot of such extensions. I've used [Moment](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moment-1-personal-dashboa/lgecddhfcfhlmllljooldkbbijdcnlpe) for a very long time. 500px.com has [it's own extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/500px-photo-new-tab-inspi/clbaflfnbbbgjppjogdmnhkgpiijamdg) already. And even the default Chrome New Tab pages shows nice pictures.

So, why another extension?

There are a lot of backend requests including some intransparent analytics procedures in Moment. It is closed source with a lot of functionality inside. If you take a look at the local session store of that extension you will see what I mean. However, if you want to have a high quality app, which provides a payed pro mode, I would stick to this extension.

The 500px extension worked fine for me, but I don't like the huge watermark and the missing offline functionality and the slow loading images. I would not suggest to use it at all.

The default page is, how to say? The default page. The pictures are nice and it works, but I don't like it. It is not a clean layout in my opinion.

# Functionality

* One out of 10 cached image is shown as new tab background image
* A new image will be downloaded from 500px if the image cache is older than x minutes (configurable update interval)
* Images are provided by [my gallery](https://500px.com/p/olibu/galleries/500NewTabs) or discovery mode
* Your name can be defined in options
* Greetings can be hidden to have a even more clean UI
* Force cache update in options page
* Images in cache are only updated if new images are available
* Link to 500px.com to support the photographer
